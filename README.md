# Gumtree Enhancement Suite (Chrome Extension)

## Why?
GumTree's website is missing a few "modern" features. This makes trawling through their site a little bit of a pain. When looking for rooms, they can be gone within a couple of hours, especially in busy cities where demand is high.

## What?
This Chrome extension/plugin will has the following features:

- [x] Infinite Scroll/Never Ending Adverts
- [x] Map location of adverts
- [x] Notifications (in browser) of new adverts
- [x] Works with the current search functionality

## How?
GumTree has no API. This is a Pain. This plugin uses jQuery and AJAX to screen-scrape the relevent pages for information. As the extension works in-page, it is not Cross Domain.

## Disclaimer
Gumtree, I'm really sorry to have to develop this. Your site just didn't have the features I needed. The plugin is in a really early stage and 'hacked' together in an afternoon.
